# beerme-app
When I'm at the grocery store or at the local pub, the nerd in me likes to know more about the beer I'm drinking. What's the ABV? What ingredients were used? Where's the brewery located? I started wire framing ideas for an app that would allow users to unlock interesting information about every craft beer all the way from Paris, France to small town Verona, Wisconsin. I chose the BrewderyDB API because of it's well written documentation, active support community, and open source culture. The app took roughly three weeks from conception to deployment, and it's already received positive feedback and feature requests from testers.
